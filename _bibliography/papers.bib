  abstract = {Exercising regularly is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health, yet the challenge of sustaining consistent exercise habits persists. Understanding the factors that influence the formation of these habits is crucial for developing effective interventions.  This study utilizes data from Mars Athletic Club, Türkiye's largest sports chain, to investigate the dynamics of gym attendance and habit formation. The general problem addressed by this study is identifying the critical periods and factors that contribute to the successful establishment of consistent exercise routines among gym-goers. Here we show that there are specific periods during which gym attendance is most crucial for habit formation. By developing a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns, we pinpoint these critical periods and segment members into distinct clusters based on their visit patterns. Our analysis reveals significant differences in how various subgroups respond to interventions, such as group classes, personal trainer sessions, and visiting different clubs. Using causal inference analysis, we demonstrate that personalized guidance and social dynamics are key drivers of sustained long-term engagement. By systematically examining these variables and considering the specific characteristics of different clusters, our research demonstrates the importance of a tailored, multi-dimensional approach to promoting exercise habits, which integrates social dynamics, personalized guidance, and strategic interventions to sustain long-term engagement.},

  abstract={In the context of Turkiye's most recent parliamentary and presidential elections (“seçim” in Turkish), social media has played an important role in shaping public debate. It is of utmost importance to capture social media trends during the 2023 Turkish elections, since it uncovers a great deal of information of election propaganda, political debates, smear campaigns, and election manipulation by domestic and international actors. We provide a comprehensive dataset for social media researchers to study Turkish elections, develop tools to prevent online manipulation, and gather novel information to inform the public. We are committed to continually improving the data collection and updating it regularly leading up to the election. Using the #Secim2023 dataset, researchers can examine the social and communication networks between political actors, track current trends, and investigate emerging threats to election integrity. Our dataset and analysis code available through Harvard Dataverse and Github, respectively.},

  title = {Decoding Istanbul's Vehicular Veins: A Network Science Exploration of Metropolitan Traffic Dynamics},
  journal = {Preprint},
  year = {2023},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {This project employs the techniques of network science to investigate and discern the underlying patterns of traffic flow in Istanbul, one of the world’s busiest cities. Using the data collected by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, we seek to identify and analyze the major traffic nodes and intersections that exert a significant influence on the city’s overall traffic dynamics. The objective of our research is to understand the complex and interrelated systems that contribute to the unique traffic behavior of Istanbul and identify critical points of congestion. With a network science approach, we propose a model that incorporates spatial correlation and linear diffusion across different locations, drawing on various traffic parameters. The results from this investigation include an identification of the key locations on overall traffic flow and a better understanding of traffic pattern variations. The insights from this research will not only address Istanbul’s traffic congestion issues but will also enrich the broader field of urban traffic systems, aiding strategic transportation planning in other metropolitan cities grappling with similar challenges.},
