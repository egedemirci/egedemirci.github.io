  abstract = {This study investigates the factors that affect the establishment of consistent exercise habits, utilizing data from Mars Athletic Club, the largest sports chain in Turkey. We developed a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns to define enduring exercise habits and applied causal inference techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions, such as group classes and personal training. Our research highlights the significant role of social interactions and structured commitments in promoting regular exercise routines. By identifying effective motivational strategies, this study provides practical insights for gyms and health organizations aiming to improve public health through sustained physical activity.},

  abstract={In the context of Turkiye's most recent parliamentary and presidential elections (“seçim” in Turkish), social media has played an important role in shaping public debate. It is of utmost importance to capture social media trends during the 2023 Turkish elections, since it uncovers a great deal of information of election propaganda, political debates, smear campaigns, and election manipulation by domestic and international actors. We provide a comprehensive dataset for social media researchers to study Turkish elections, develop tools to prevent online manipulation, and gather novel information to inform the public. We are committed to continually improving the data collection and updating it regularly leading up to the election. Using the #Secim2023 dataset, researchers can examine the social and communication networks between political actors, track current trends, and investigate emerging threats to election integrity. Our dataset and analysis code available through Harvard Dataverse and Github, respectively.},

  title = {Decoding Istanbul’s Vehicular Veins: A Network Science Exploration of Metropolitan Traffic Dynamics},
  journal = {Preprint},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {This project employs the techniques of network science to investigate and discern the underlying patterns of traffic flow in Istanbul, one of the world’s busiest cities. Using the data collected by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, we seek to identify and analyze the major traffic nodes and intersections that exert a significant influence on the city’s overall traffic dynamics. The objective of our research is to understand the complex and interrelated systems that contribute to the unique traffic behavior of Istanbul and identify critical points of congestion. With a network science approach, we propose a model that incorporates spatial correlation and linear diffusion across different locations, drawing on various traffic parameters. The results from this investigation include an identification of the key locations on overall traffic flow and a better understanding of traffic pattern variations. The insights from this research will not only address Istanbul’s traffic congestion issues but will also enrich the broader field of urban traffic systems, aiding strategic transportation planning in other metropolitan cities grappling with similar challenges.},
