description: My work mainly focuses on machine learning for graph-structured data, with emphasis on symmetry/equivariance and representation learning, designing symmetry-preserving, physics-aware systems that learn expressive, data-efficient graph representations. In my first-year, I built an equivariant model for flow prediction and structure inference in critical infrastructure networks, integrating physical constraints to improve accuracy and robustness.
