description: My research primarily focuses on graph machine learning, with an emphasis on symmetry, equivariance, and geometric deep learning. I aim to design physics-aware systems that learn expressive, data-efficient graph representations. Most recently, I built FlowSymm, a symmetry-preserving graph attention mechanism for network flow completion, and I am currently exploring mixed-curvature geometries for link prediction. Previously, I also examined the intersection of LLMs and structured data, evaluating the graph reasoning capabilities of generative models.
