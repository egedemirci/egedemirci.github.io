description: My research primarily focuses on **graph machine learning**, with an emphasis on symmetry, equivariance, and geometric deep learning. I aim to design physics-aware systems that learn expressive, data-efficient graph representations. Most recently, I built **FlowSymm**, a symmetry-preserving graph attention mechanism for network flow completion ([ICLR 2026](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=vu1IEpdUQh)), and I am currently exploring mixed-curvature geometries for link prediction. Previously, I also examined the intersection of LLMs and structured data, evaluating the graph reasoning capabilities of generative models ([ACL 2025 SRW](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-srw.64/)).
