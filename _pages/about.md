I am a first year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducting research in the [DYNAMO Lab](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Ambuj Singh](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ambuj/). My work mainly focuses on machine learning on graph-structured data, with the goal of developing advanced techniques for predicting network structure and flows, critical to planning and optimizing infrastructure systems.

I graduated as valedictorian in June 2024 from [Sabanci University](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering. For three years, I worked as a research assistant at [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com), where we investigated human behaviors and societal patterns by integrating both online and offline data, under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com).

During my time at Sabanci University, my research primarily focused on exploring how actors execute misinformation and propaganda campaigns to promote ideas in the politically charged environment of the 2023 Turkish elections on social media, using machine learning and network science techniques. In my final year, my work centered on habit formation, employing causal inference and machine learning techniques to investigate factors influencing the establishment of consistent exercise habits.

## research interests

My research interests can be summarized with few keywords:

- **Machine Learning on Graphs**: Developing and applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data to gain insights into networked systems.
- **Network Science**: Investigating the structure and dynamics of social networks, and how they influence individual and collective behavior. Studying the formation, evolution, and impact of social networks on various aspects of society.
- **Machine Learning for Social Good**: Applying machine learning methods to address social issues and improve public well-being.
- **Causal Inference**: Evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and understanding causality in complex systems, particularly in the context of digital media and social networks.
