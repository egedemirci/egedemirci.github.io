I am a second year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducting research in the [DYNAMO Lab](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Ambuj Singh](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ambuj/). My work mainly focuses on machine learning for graph-structured data, with emphasis on symmetry/equivariance and representation learning, designing symmetry-preserving, physics-aware systems that learn expressive, data-efficient graph representations. In my first-year, I built an equivariant model for flow prediction and structure inference in critical infrastructure networks, integrating physical constraints to improve accuracy and robustness.

I graduated as valedictorian in June 2024 from [Sabanci University](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering. For three years, I worked as a research assistant at [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com), where we investigated human behaviors and societal patterns by integrating both online and offline data, under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com).

During my time at Sabanci University, my research primarily focused on exploring how actors execute misinformation and propaganda campaigns to promote ideas in the politically charged environment of the 2023 Turkish elections on social media, using machine learning and network science techniques. In my final year, my work centered on habit formation, employing causal inference and machine learning techniques to investigate factors influencing the establishment of consistent exercise habits.

## research interests

My research interests can be summarized with few keywords:

- **Machine Learning on Graphs**: Developing and applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data to gain insights into networked systems.
- **Symmetry and Equivariance**: Using group actions and invariances to build symmetry-preserving GNNs that respect physical laws (e.g., conservation, permutation/rotational symmetry), boosting sample efficiency and out-of-domain generalization.
- **Representation Learning**: Designing expressive, transferable graph representations (e.g., positional encodings; contrastive/self-supervised objectives) that improve robustness and generalization under distribution shift and sparse labels.

In the past, I also worked in:

- **Network Science**: Studying the structure and dynamics of social and infrastructure networks, including cascades, robustness, and information diffusion.
- **Computational Social Science**: Modeling behavior and information ecosystems in socio-technical networks (e.g., misinformation diffusion, habit formation, behavior change) using ML + causal tools.
- **Causal Inference & ML for Social Good**: Evaluating interventions and understanding causality in complex system to drive measurable public well-being.
