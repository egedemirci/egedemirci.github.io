I am a second-year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, conducting research in the [DYNAMO Lab](https://dynamo.cs.ucsb.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Ambuj Singh](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ambuj/).

My research primarily focuses on **graph machine learning**, with an emphasis on symmetry, equivariance, and geometric deep learning. I aim to design physics-aware systems that learn expressive, data-efficient graph representations. Most recently, I built **FlowSymm**, a symmetry-preserving graph attention mechanism for network flow completion ([ICLR 2026](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=vu1IEpdUQh)), and I am currently exploring mixed-curvature geometries for link prediction. Previously, I also examined the intersection of LLMs and structured data, evaluating the graph reasoning capabilities of generative models ([ACL 2025 SRW](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-srw.64/)).

I graduated as valedictorian in June 2024 from [Sabanci University](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering. For three years, I worked as a research assistant at [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com) under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com), where I used network science to analyze misinformation campaigns during the 2023 Turkish elections. In my final year, I collaborated with [Mars Athletic](https://www.macfit.com/en/about-us), where I applied causal inference techniques to model habit formation mechanisms from large-scale behavioral data ([IC2S2 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01779)).


## research interests

My current research interests can be summarized with few keywords:

- **Machine Learning on Graphs**: Developing and applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data to gain insights into networked systems.
- **Symmetry and Equivariance**: Using group actions and invariances to build symmetry-preserving GNNs that respect physical laws (e.g., conservation, permutation/rotational symmetry), boosting sample efficiency and out-of-domain generalization.
- **Representation Learning**: Designing expressive, transferable graph representations (e.g., positional encodings; contrastive/self-supervised objectives) that improve robustness and generalization under distribution shift and sparse labels.

In the past, I also worked in:

- **Network Science**: Studying the structure and dynamics of social and infrastructure networks, including cascades, robustness, and information diffusion.
- **Computational Social Science**: Modeling behavior and information ecosystems in socio-technical networks (e.g., misinformation diffusion, habit formation, behavior change) using ML + causal tools.
- **Causal Inference & ML for Social Good**: Evaluating interventions and understanding causality in complex system to drive measurable public well-being.
