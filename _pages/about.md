I am currently a senior B.Sc. student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.sabanciuniv.edu/) at Sabanci University. I work as a research assistant at [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com), under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com), where I investigate human behaviors and societal patterns by seamlessly integrating both online and offline data.

My research is centered on analyzing the intricate dynamics of social networks, emphasizing the roles these networks play in shaping individual beliefs and collective behaviors. I use a combination of computational social science, machine learning, and network science methods to conduct my research. 
  
For collaborations, inquiries, or simply to connect, [my DMs are always open.](mailto:egedemirci@sabanciuniv.edu)
