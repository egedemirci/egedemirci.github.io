      <p>I love listening to music in my spare time. I also have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/egelistens"> Instagram blog </a> where I write about the albums I listen to from time to time. I like to dig into the details of the music, but at the end of the day, I'm not more than a casual listener. I listen to basically everything, but the main genres I'm into are alternative/indie rock, permanent wave, and art pop. Below is a small list of my favorite albums. If you were to listen to only one album or one song from this list, I would definitely recommend Humbug / Crying Lightning. In addition to the albums, the playlist containing my favorite songs which can define my music taste  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5stjMvOcwbi2QePJf926A4?si=ed9f5a2474c84465"> can be reached via this link </a>, you can reach to my Spotify from this link as well! And if you are one of the few people who still uses last.fm, you can see <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/egedemirci">  my entire music history from past to present. </a>

      <p>I am also interested in cinema, although not as much as music. While I was at Sabancı, I was the president of the cinema club for a long time. I can say that I am a much more mainstream audience in cinema. You can also see my movie archive on <a href="https://www.letterboxd.com/egedemirci/">  my Letterboxd account.</p>

    <p>Apart from these, I have been in love with football since my childhood. I am a fan of Besiktas and Manchester United. My favorite periods from history are Sir Alex Ferguson's 07-08 Manchester United, which won the Champions League in Moscow, and the 2015-2017 Beşiktaş squad, which was the best team in the league and almost made it to the semi-finals of the Europa League. World Cup tournaments have a special place in my heart (2010 South Africa, 2014 Brazil), it always brings back a lot of memories from my childhood. </p>
